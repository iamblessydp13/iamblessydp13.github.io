<br>Well, signing up is one, filling up your profile with the right content is another but the after setting-up the basics is where the real magic happens. <br> 
<br>The core reasons LinkedIn is not working for you is because:  
<br>  
<br><em>Your personal brand isn't clear  
<br>You're not confident nor clear what you're selling  
<br>You're overwhelmed consuming more than you are creating 
</em><br>   
<br>This program is intensive and challenging. <strong>There are no silver bullets, simple formulas, or guaranteed results if you don't put out the work</strong>.<br><br> It's time for you to stand out, share your message, and shape your personal brand on LinkedIn to draw in those aligned opportunities for your hustle.</p>

<br>
<br>By examining customers’ end-to-end experience, it provides clarity when it comes to content opportunities especially the glaring gaps where would-be customers are getting lost along the way. 
<br>
<br><strong>Authenticity</strong> is unleashing your message without the need to filter. Forget comparison syndrome and <strong><em>triple down on your own message.</em></strong><br><br><em>My primary goal is to help each other to train ourselves to think, behave and make smart decisions like an entrepreneur even if you're a side-hustler or a corporate professional. Together, let's show up and curate a strategy made for you.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><br></em></strong></p>

Now, to differentiate your job and self-driven business, you'd have to focus on which amongst the two will you zoom in on this program. However, this doesn't mean you can't inject both worlds.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't I need a certification first before I can start coaching business?&nbsp;</strong><br>It'll be cool if you'll have one but a certification is not a prerequisite to start a coaching business. Certifications are there to represent a guarantee that you've logged in hours of coaching under an upfront investment certificate ranges up until $8000. While it'll be awesome to have such recognition, a certificate doesn't guarantee you'll have a successful business. You need real-world experience and actual practice with soul-led clients and create an impact at the same time earn from what you love passionately doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                            <li><strong>Will I have access to the course as soon as I get into the program?&nbsp;</strong><br>Yes.

Once you sign-up, you'll be included in the invitation list for you to send in your intent to join the program and be part of the tribe. If you want to do the program again, you may join at no extra charge but you'd have to come in with an empty cup and encourage others as a supporting coach.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

The training will run for at least an hour and the worksheets will be self-paced. I encourage you to keep the pulse running and implement. Get your 'perfection' judgment out of the window for now and activate the learner in you.</li>

What if I'm job hunting?</strong><br>As much as we want to serve everyone, this program is designed for entrepreneurs and would-be proprietors. We'll zoom in content around your mission, messaging, and your personal brand to drive and attract clients to your service or product. If you’re job hunting though, you may strengthen your authority through content creation designed for the expertise you specialize or would want to specialise on. We'll be releasing a specific program for you, soon.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li><strong>I'm just about to hop in as a proprietor and pledge to commit as an entrepreneur, how do I juggle this with my employer?&nbsp;</strong><br>This has always been one of the pressing concerns of my students. You see, it's important for you to be transparent with your boss, tell him/her what's important for you and why you're going to embark on this entrepreneurship path. Discuss this thoroughly with your employer and weigh in objectively. Wishing you all the best!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                            <li><strong>What If I don't have time to commit 8 Weeks for the foundation and pursue the entire 6 months program??&nbsp;</strong><br>If you’re not willing to put in some time and energy, then you won’t be creating outstanding results. This is just the truth and it’s true for all of us. However, I have designed this program in a way that offers you the perfect balance between getting stuff done, being held accountable and creating forward momentum… whilst having enough time to take action and implement. (Even if you’re currently working on your side hustle and you still have a job, a family and other things calling for your attention).</li>

                            <li><strong>Is there a refund policy?</strong><br>Participate in up to the second module from the start of the live program. If you no longer feel that intensive program is right for you, send us an email.  However, we’ll ask for your completed coursework to make sure you gave it a go, and ask what didn’t work for you so we can learn and improve. Your first month is non-refundable. Once we receive your completed coursework, you’ll get a swift and receive the succeeding installment refund.&nbsp; 
The reason we ask for your completed coursework is simple. We only want to work with people who are truly committed to taking massive, consistent action and using the ideas and strategies to create real change.&nbsp; &nbsp;The deadline exists because, if you sign up for this intensive program, we want you to get started. We pour enormous human effort into this program and we want to devote that effort to students who are committed. We are, after-all, ambitious humans who are all for the success of each other. If you don’t plan on starting right away, make sure this is the right investment for you as the refund period does have a firm deadline (Only up until the second module of the program). Your deposit and first month installment is non-refundable.If you do the intensive program and coursework and don’t get the value, submit your completed homework within the first three module weeks, and get a full and complete refund. Simple as that.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li><strong>Can you guarantee results in this program for me?</strong>YOU can control your success. ONLY IF YOU SHOW UP and do the work with intent. Results will vary with each individual and how much time and investment you pour your energy and focus you put in to have your message across, building and optimising your personal brand and how open you are with self-assessment. Only you can guarantee results, if you let it, if you allow it.<strong>&nbsp;
<span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">If you’re ready to show up and commit on driving your ambition further and farther, planting the seeds and sowing them with and through time will come beneficial in return. Stay generous, kind and all about service - you'll receive massive intentional and purpose-led results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></li>
